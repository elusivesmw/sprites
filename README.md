## Bounce Sprite Spawner

Placeable bounce sprite in Lunar Magic. Used to spawn a bounce sprite, such as a turnblock in its turning state (as seen in [my KLDC 2022 level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrvxhfPcTnI&ab_channel=elusivesmw))

## Ghost House Entrance

WIP: Disassembly of the ghost house entrance door. Used to make interactive cutscenes before a ghost house level. The ghost house door will open when mario gets near, and reclose after.
